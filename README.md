# Multimodal-Anomaly-Detection-for-Marketing

A research project focused on detecting anomalies in real-time marketing campaigns by leveraging multimodal data fusion across vision, text, and time series modalities.

**Goal:**
Enhance marketing strategy optimization and campaign management by automatically identifying suspicious behaviors and performance anomalies.

---

## 📚 Project Overview

In modern marketing ecosystems, campaign performance is influenced by heterogeneous data sources such as:

-   📈 **Time series** — e.g., engagement metrics, click-through rates.
-   🖼️ **Visual data** — e.g., campaign images, banners.
-   📝 **Textual content** — e.g., ad copy, social media descriptions.

This project integrates these diverse modalities into a unified anomaly detection pipeline capable of:

-   Monitoring campaigns in near real-time.
-   Identifying unexpected patterns and underperforming content.
-   Supporting proactive decision-making for marketing teams.

---

## 🛠️ Key Components

-   **Data Preprocessing Pipelines** for each modality.
-   **Feature Extraction** from images (CNN-based), text (NLP embeddings), and time series (signal processing and statistical features).
-   **Multimodal Fusion** techniques to combine the extracted representations.
-   **Anomaly Detection Models** leveraging traditional ML algorithms and deep learning methods.

**Structure Description:**

1.  **`data/`**: This folder holds the datasets used for the project.
    * `raw/`: Store the original, unmodified data files here (e.g., CSVs, JSON files downloaded from sources like Kaggle).
    * `processed/`: Contains data after preprocessing, cleaning, and transformation, ready for analysis and model training. This might include normalized data, handled missing values, encoded categorical features, etc.
2.  **`notebooks/`**: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks used for documenting the development process, experimentation, and analysis.
    * `01_data_exploration.ipynb`: Focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and understanding dataset characteristics.
    * `02_data_preprocessing.ipynb`: Details the steps taken for data preprocessing, including cleaning, normalization, and feature scaling.
    * `03_model_development.ipynb`: Contains the code for building, training, and tuning the machine learning models.
    * `04_evaluation.ipynb`: Used for evaluating the trained models using relevant metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
3.  **`src/`**: This directory houses the project's source code, organized into modules.
    * `data_preprocessing.py`: Functions for loading, cleaning, and preprocessing data.
    * `feature_engineering.py`: Scripts dedicated to creating new features from raw data (e.g., image transformations, text embeddings).
    * `model.py`: Defines the architecture and logic of the machine learning models used.
    * `evaluation.py`: Functions to compute and report model evaluation metrics.
    * `utils.py`: Contains general utility functions used across the project, such as configuration loading, logging setup, or common helper functions.
4.  **`models/`**: Trained machine learning models are saved in this directory (e.g., as `.pkl` or `.h5` files) for later use without retraining.
5.  **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all Python libraries and dependencies required to run the project. Ensures reproducibility by allowing others to set up the environment easily using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
6.  **`README.md`**: Provides a comprehensive overview of the project, objectives, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.
7.  **`.gitignore`**: Specifies files and directories that Git should ignore (e.g., large data files, virtual environments, cached files, saved models that aren't meant to be versioned).

## 🚀 Getting Started

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/LucaReggiani-AI-Projects/Multimodal-Anomaly-Detection-for-Marketing.git](https://github.com/LucaReggiani-AI-Projects/Multimodal-Anomaly-Detection-for-Marketing.git)
    cd Multimodal-Anomaly-Detection-for-Marketing
    ```
2.  Install the required dependencies:
