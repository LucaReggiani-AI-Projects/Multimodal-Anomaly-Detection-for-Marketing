# Multimodal-Anomaly-Detection-for-Marketing

A research project focused on detecting anomalies in real-time marketing campaigns by leveraging multimodal data fusion across vision, text, and time series modalities.

**Goal:**  
Enhance marketing strategy optimization and campaign management by automatically identifying suspicious behaviors and performance anomalies.

---

## 📚 Project Overview

In modern marketing ecosystems, campaign performance is influenced by heterogeneous data sources such as:

- 📈 **Time series** — e.g., engagement metrics, click-through rates.
- 🖼️ **Visual data** — e.g., campaign images, banners.
- 📝 **Textual content** — e.g., ad copy, social media descriptions.

This project integrates these diverse modalities into a unified anomaly detection pipeline capable of:

- Monitoring campaigns in near real-time.
- Identifying unexpected patterns and underperforming content.
- Supporting proactive decision-making for marketing teams.

---

## 🛠️ Key Components

- **Data Preprocessing Pipelines** for each modality.
- **Feature Extraction** from images (CNN-based), text (NLP embeddings), and time series (signal processing and statistical features).
- **Multimodal Fusion** techniques to combine the extracted representations.
- **Anomaly Detection Models** leveraging traditional ML algorithms and deep learning methods.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LucaReggiani-AI-Projects/Multimodal-Anomaly-Detection-for-Marketing.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Follow the instructions in the notebooks/ folder to preprocess the data, train models, and evaluate results.

## 📈 Future Directions

- Integrate transformer-based models for better feature extraction.
- Extend anomaly detection to cross-campaign and multi-brand analyses.
- Develop real-time deployment prototypes for marketing teams.
